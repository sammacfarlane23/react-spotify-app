## Spotify Playlist Merger

I built this app when I could not find an easy way to merge mutliple playlists on Spotify into one. This app lets you do just that, as well as showing you your top artists and tracks over your chosen period.

This is a React app that uses the Spotify API to get a user's top tracks and artists on Spotify and lets them merge multiple playlists into one
